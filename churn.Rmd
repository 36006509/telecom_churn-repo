# TELECOM CHURN PREDICTION

We will try to some predictions. The Orange telecom's churn dataset have been uploaded from Kaggle and you can easily access to it by clicking to this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets "link to the dataset")

## Loading all packages

```{r load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(parsnip)
library(yardstick)
library(workflowsets)
library(dplyr)
library(read)
```

## import our data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
churn<- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/36006509/telecom_churn-repo/churn-bigml-80.csv",row.names = 'X',
        stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
